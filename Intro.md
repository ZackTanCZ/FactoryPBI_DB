# Introduction

## Who, What and How

* 'Who' refers to your **audience** or **the users** of the dashboard. Generally, we can identify 'Who' by narrowing down **decision makers**
  * Avoid general audiences (e.g. Stakeholders, or anyone who is interested) as it negatively affect your ability to communicate effectively with either groups.

* 'What' refers to the **information** your audience need to know or **actions** to do.
  * Think about the **relevance** of what you're communicating and **emphasize** why this is important to them.
  * The point is to always want your audience to **know** or **do something**

* 'How' refers to answering the question 'What data is available to help make my point'.
  * Data becomes supporting evidence to the story you build and present.  

## The 3-minute story and Big Idea

> Essentially, condense the 'so-what' to a paragraph and consequently, one single concise statement

### 3 minute story

  > If you only had three minutes to tell your audience what they need to know , what would you say?

This helps to ensure you're clear on and can articulate the story you want to tell. It also prevents relying on slides/visuals for a quick brief toward stakeholders.

  <summary>Example</summary>

The science department brainstormed ways to address incoming fourth-graders' negative perceptions of science. 
They piloted a summer program for second and third graders to provide earlier science exposure and foster positive attitudes. 
Surveys before and after the program showed a significant shift from "OK" to interested in science, with nearly 70% expressing interest afterward. 
The department considers the pilot successful and plans to continue and expand the program.

### Big Idea

  'Big Idea' boils the 'so-what' down to a single sentence, consisting of three component:

   1. It must articulate your unique point of view;
   2. It must convey what's at stake; and
   3. It must be a complete sentence
